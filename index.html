            <div class="thetext1" id="thetext1">
              <p id="projc1">It all started when I was 8, I got my first laptop and I was very excited.
                At first I used the laptop mostly for gaming, mainly minecraft.
              </p>

              <img src="images/minecraft-1-logo-png-transparent.png">

              <p id="projc2">And minecraft, when I started my cyber security, there was one server that was
                very popular and it was
                also in my native language, it was called PvPBulgaria.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/pvpbg.png">

              <p id="projc3">
                There was a lot of cheating, once me and my friend were talking on skype and my friend clicked
                on a link
                in minecraft private chat.

                <br><br>His internet suddenly stopped, he came back online after 5 minutes and this is how I learned
                about ddosing and how I can protect myself from it.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/ddos.png">

              <p id="projc4">
                That's pretty much how I learned how I can ddos ​​someone, what I need, what tools I need to use, the
                attack methods and of course how I need to protect myself with a vpn and some firewall settings.

                <br><br>Now that I know how to attack someone or something, I also need to learn how to defend it, I
                started hosting minecraft servers and the first thing that came to my mind was, how do I publish the
                server online?
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/servers.png">

              <p id="projc5">I saw videos that people host it on their own computers, but it's very dangerous and you
                have to modify
                your router, so I said no, and then I found this ngrok tool, which wasn't very popular at the time, and
                I published the server with it!</p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/ngrok.png">

              <p id="projc6">Now I realized I have to keep the computer on so that means I still host the server on my
                computer and
                I didn't want to pay for a host so that why I gave up but I still had a lot of experience with minecraft
                servers like plugins etc.
                <br><br>I even ran a kinda successful minecraft server back in the day, about 30/40 people playing a
                day. But I had to shut down my computer every night.
                <br><br>So, how I said I gave up, but I gained so much experience about hosting and creating
                protections.
                <br><br>Alright so everything seemed normal.In 2017 when they released fortnite i really wanted a gaming
                pc
                so i could play it.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/fortnite.png">

              <p id="projc7">
                And finally after a few months I got a gaming PC! I remember
                it was season 5 and I was playing all day.

                <br><br>So one day I searched on youtube how can I get free fortnite skins and back in the days youtube
                didn't really protect the videos for cracking or any illegal stuff like in 2022/2023.

                <br><br>I watched the tutorial it was pretty simple just public combo leech and epic games account
                checker I followed the tutorial and just cracked my first account even remembered it had 2 skins!
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/crack.png">

              <p id="projc8">If you're wondering why I'm telling you what illegal things I did, firstly I was very
                young, 13, and
                secondly, there's no actual proof maybe im just lying.

                <br><br>Anyway I started looking for private methods and found one very HQ method, there was one leecher
                named
                smart pastebin leecher, I know what you think leechers are public but this one wasn't!

                <br><br>I started getting so many hits, I had so many accounts I went crazy, I even started selling at
                school.

                <br><br>Then I was like lets check the accounts for other hits like minecraft,steam,origin and so on ..
                I found a lot of interesting multi checkers, not only but also brute force ones.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/brute.png">


              <p id="projc9">I got very addicted, I started learning how to do hq combos using sqli, I'll keep that part
                a secret,
                anyway after that I started learning about hq proxies, but I realized I either have to buy them or find
                them very nice method where i can scrape them from the website so it was quite unsuccessful.

                <br><br>Well, enough about the cracking part, I have gained a lot of experience, not only how hackers
                can crack your password, but also how you can protect yourself, I also didn't mention the checkers and
                apis..

                <br><br>So of course over the years I got a lot of viruses from the tools I used, so I learned about
                vms, vps, sandboxie, etc. I learned how I can remove malwares, backdoors, rats, etc.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/malware.png">

              <p id="projc10">Overall I learned so much, of course this is just a short story of how it all started, I
                didn't include
                much.</p>

          <h3 id="boxtext2" class="hover">Coding <br><span class="beg">Journey</span></h2>

            <div class="thetext2" id="thetext2">

              <p id="projb1">It all started with basic html when I was about 10/11 years old.</p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/html.png">

              <p id="projb2">Honestly I couldn't do anything myself so I just copied code from youtube and was very
                proud lol and
                always coded in notepad.

                <br><br>I didn't know what ide was or even css, I just used notepad and plain html.
                <br><br>So if you've read my cyber security journey you know I've been hacking accounts so one day I
                decided to start a Discord group and website and I did.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/discord.png">

              <p id="projb3">It was actually quite successful, I was doing giveaways, I even had an account generator,
                but the
                website was very bad, how did I say I only knew pure html so it was trash.

                <br><br>I later removed the discord group and gave up making websites because it was too hard.
                <br><br>Years later a friend of mine said I was some kind of hacker because I was able to build websites
                and that gave me motivation so I started again!
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/hacker.png">

              <p id="projb4">This time I learned about css and started creating html/css projects oh and this time I
                used actual ide
                - visual studio code.
                <br><br>Everything was great until I realized that I needed to manage my website to look good on every
                screen too. It was very difficult and I gave up again..

                <br><br>A year later I came back, learned a lot of properties in css, learned how to position things,
                learned about containers and learned how to make responsive websites!
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/responsive.png">

              <p id="projb5">I have created several websites but then something was missing? Yes Java Script.
                <br><br>Actually the java script was very easy to learn so it was a success, now that I know html, css
                and the front end java script it was time to learn the back end.
              </p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/backend.png">

              <p id="projb6">I really struggled with learning the back end but finally after a few months I did that
                too, learned
                how to communicate with servers/apis, learned how to host ones and of course node js!</p>

              <img class="custom1" src="images/success.png">

              <p id="projb7">I'm a full stack developer now and I'm only 17 so I still have a lot to learn, of course
                this isn't the
                full story of my coding journey, maybe I'll update it and include my java and c++ coding journey too.
